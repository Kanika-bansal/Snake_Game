# Snake_Game

1. A game where the player gets a pixelated snake to eat pellets without running into itself (It can pass through the wall).
2. The snake can move in 4 directions (left, up, down, right) using A, W, S, D keys.
3. Once the game starts the snake keeps moving continously, the player can only change its direction.
